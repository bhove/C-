/*
*	Can you describe what each line of code does and why it's needed?
    Yes.
*	What is the purpose of a structure?
    A structure holds multiple types of variables and data.
*	Can you readily write the code to define any structure with multiple pieces of data?
    Yes
*	What is the purpose of an array?
An array is a set of multiple values of the same variable.
*	How is an array of size 15 indexed?
    0-14
*	What is the code needed to find a student by name in roster?
    string name;
    int i;

        cout << endl;
        cout << "Enter the student's name: ";
        cin.ignore();
        getline(cin, name);
        cout << endl;

    i = 0;
        while (i < numstus && roster[i].name != name) {
            i++;
        }
        if (i < numstus)
            cout << "Found!" << endl;
        else
            cout << "You're a failure!" << endl;
*	What is the code needed to sort roster by gpa?
    int i, j;
    student temp;

        for (i = 0; i < numstus - 1; i++)
            for (j = i + 1; j < numstus; j++)
                if (roster[i].gpa > roster[j].gpa) {
                    temp = roster[i];
                    roster[i] = roster[j];
                    roster[j] = temp;
                }
    printall(roster, numstus);
*	What is the code needed to convert a string to an int? a float?
    getline(infile, s, '\n');
    roster[i].gpa = atof (s.c_str());
*	Why is all data read from a data file a string?
    The program reads each individual line as a string as it is stored in text.
*	To delete a student from roster, can we simply erase the values in that position of the array and put default values there?
    No, you must also move down all existing students above the removed
*	Why do we need both SIZE and numstus?
    SIZE is a constant for the maximum # of students, numstus is the actual number of students.
*	How is roster returned from any function with updated data since we don't say return roster???
    As roster is defined outside and before any functions, all functions know it exists.
*	What happens if I return numstus, but don't "catch" it in main?
    Numstus then does not change in main.
*	When finding a highest or lowest value in an array we typically set the high / low value to the first value in the array to start. Why did we not do that for highestgpainyear in gradebook?
    We do this as GPA is a calculation based on the 5 grades.
*	Can you readily write the code to find the high / low value in an int array or array of structures?
    Yes.
*	Can any function call any other function or do they all have to be called by main only?
    No, any function can call other functions as long as they are defined before them.
*	What is a switch statement used instead of? * What's the purpose of a break statement in case statements?
    An if/else if/else chain. Break tells the computer there are no more lines to read.
